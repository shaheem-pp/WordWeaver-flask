## Technologies Used

| Technology | Description |
|---|---|
| **Python** | The core programming language used for the backend logic of the application. |
| **Flask** | A micro web framework used for building the web application, handling routes, and serving HTML templates. |
| **beautifulsoup4** | (If used for web scraping/parsing text) A library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files, potentially used for processing text input. |
| **matplotlib** | A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python, likely used for rendering parts of the word cloud or other visual elements. |
| **numpy** | A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, often used for numerical operations, especially when dealing with image data or statistical calculations for word frequencies. |
| **pillow** | A friendly PIL (Python Imaging Library) fork, used for image processing tasks, such as handling and saving the generated word cloud images. |
| **requests** | An elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, potentially used for fetching text from URLs if that feature is implemented. |
| **wordcloud** | A library for generating word clouds, which is the core functionality of this application. |
